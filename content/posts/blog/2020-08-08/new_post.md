I was wondering if this would work. This only really a test. The first paragraph of this post contains a lot of words that are used with the purpose of testing how the blog is displayed online. <br/><br/>

Considering the amount of effort we have put into this, we have decided to save it for later just to test the capacities of our local markdown editor. There are a lot of options for markdown editors but Mark Text seems to be the best one so far. <br/><br/>

## Hello this is some Heading

I did this just to introduce another section to the post. Do we have anything else to say? Not really. But we can continue adding words just for the sake of it. <br/> <br/>
